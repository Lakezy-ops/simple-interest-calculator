# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple command-line tool or script that calculates the interest earned or paid on a loan/investment over a period of time.

## Description
This project is part of a curriculum to demonstrate basic programming logic and repository management. It calculates simple interest using the standard mathematical formula.

## Formula
The calculation is based on the formula:
**I = P * r * t**

Where:
- **I** = Simple Interest
- **P** = Principal amount
- **r** = Annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- **t** = Time period (in years)

## How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Input the Principal, Rate, and Time when prompted.
3. The script will output the calculated Simple Interest.
